# Two-Dimension-Transformation-Translation
In translation, an object is displaced a given distance and direction from its original position. A point in the XY plane can be translated by adding translation amount to the coordinates of the point. For each point P(X,Y) which is to be moved by TX unites parallel to the X-axis and by TY units parallel to the Y-axis to the new point P2(X2,Y2) we use the equations:

X2=X+TX
Y2=Y+TY

If TX is positive then the point moves to right
If TX is negative then the point moves to left
If TY is positive then the point moves up (in PC moves down)
If TY is negative then the point moves down (in PC moves up)

The transformation of Translation can be represented by (3*3) matrix:


Example2: translate a triangle with vertices at original coordinates (10,20), (10,10), (20,10) by tx=5, ty=10 use matrix representation
